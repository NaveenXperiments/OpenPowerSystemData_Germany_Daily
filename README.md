# OpenPowerSystemData_Germany_Daily Analysis

This repository contains a data science project that analyzes the daily electricity consumption and renewable energy production (wind and solar) in Germany. The analysis is performed using the OpenPowerSystemData dataset, and the project includes various stages such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and trend analysis.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains daily records of:

- **Consumption**: Daily electricity consumption in GWh (Gigawatt hours)
- **Wind**: Daily electricity generated by wind in GWh
- **Solar**: Daily electricity generated by solar in GWh
- **Wind+Solar**: Combined daily electricity generated by wind and solar in GWh

This project involves:

1. Loading and cleaning the data
2. Visualizing trends in electricity consumption and renewable energy production
3. Calculating moving averages for trend smoothing
4. Decomposing the seasonal patterns in the consumption data
5. Analyzing correlations between different energy variables
6. Aggregating data for yearly insights
7. Visualizing specific time periods, such as the year 2016

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x along with the following packages. These libraries are essential for performing data manipulation, visualization, and time series analysis.

- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides easy-to-use data structures like DataFrames and functions for reading and writing data, handling missing values, and performing complex transformations on datasets.
  
  Install with: 
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
